# OOP2024 â€“ Object-Oriented Programming Course Projects  

This repository contains Java projects and assignments developed as part of the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** course. The projects focus on mastering core OOP principles and applying them to real-world scenarios.  

## Implemented Features and Projects  

- **Classes and Objects**: Creation and usage of classes, constructors, methods, and objects.  
- **Encapsulation**: Implementation of getter and setter methods to control access to class properties.  
- **Inheritance**: Demonstrating class hierarchies and the use of `extends` keyword.  
- **Polymorphism**: Method overloading, method overriding, and dynamic method dispatch.  
- **Abstraction**: Development of abstract classes and interfaces to define reusable components.  
- **Exception Handling**: Implementation of `try-catch` blocks, custom exceptions, and error handling mechanisms.  
- **File Input/Output**: Reading from and writing to files using Java I/O classes.  
- **Collections Framework**: Usage of `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, `LinkedList`, and other Java collections.  
- **Generics**: Creation of type-safe collections and methods using generics.  
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Development of interactive applications using **JavaFX**.  
- **Design Patterns**: Application of basic design patterns such as Singleton and Factory.
